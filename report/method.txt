## PROBLEM OF RECOMMENDATION WITH SERENDIPITY

Input: 
- U set of users
- O set of objects
- s_o (attribute-based) similarity between objects
- s_u (behavioural) similarity between users
- u a specific user asking for a recommendation among objects in O
- t serendipity threshold (in % of people in userbase/user network that have seen the object)

Output:
- object o with two characteristics:
-> likely to be enjoyed by user u: "item relevance"
-> outside what u is used to see: "item novelty"

## FORMALIZATION OF ITEM RELEVANCE AND NOVELTY

- Item relevance: ?
- Item novelty: ?

## METHOD

- Online inference of user network (let us assume for now that the set of users is fixed)
- A part of the ratings is known, the other is hidden and will be used for validation
- A priori, the set of objects is fixed and the (attribute-based) similarity graph of objects is fully known (?)
- Apply OIMP algorithm to recommend one object (candidate) to user u (a priori, horizon T = 1 ?) where little is known about the ratings of user u

## MEASURES OF VALIDATION OF RESULTS

Suggestions: expected cumulative regret from IM
- wrt item relevance: ?
- wrt item novelty: ?
