\begin{abstract}
A lacking feature of current recommender systems is that they usually do not allow discovery of new elements, that is, an element that might be interesting, but which is different of what the user is used to. Moreover, a clear definition of serendipity is missing. The goal of this project was (1) to formalize the problem of recommendation allowing serendipities, that is, surprisingly good discoveries; (2) to design a method which solves this problem in an online setting; (3) to evaluate its relevance with respect to the random strategy, usual collaborative filtering recommender system, and methods using Rotting Bandits.

\section{Formalization of the Problem of Recommendation With Serendipity}

Serendipities are objects that are unexpectedly enjoyable. A more formal definition would be, given a serendipity threshold $s$, a unweighted, undirected similarity graph $G(V, E)$ on the objects, and a given user $u$ to which recommendations would be made, serendipities are objects that are located in unexplored (with respect to the considered user) object regions (i.e. strongly connected components of the graph), at distance (in terms of length of the shortest path from explored regions to the considered unexplored region) lesser than t, such that these objects can increase in expectation the diameter of the explored regions of the similarity graph by the user across time. Formally:

* G(V, E), undirected, unweighted similarity graph on objects
* u, a user 
* f-t-u : V -> {0, 1}, a function that indicates exploration of an object by user u (at time t)
* r-u : V -> [|0, 1, 2|], a function of rating by user u of objects (1 means "not seen", 0 means "don't like", 2 means "like")
* s, serendipity threshold
Then we define the set of serendipities at a given point in time t as:
S = {v in V : v = argmax-{v' in V, v' at distance min. s of an explored region of u} E(sum-{v" in V} [f-{t+1}-u(v")-f-{t}-u(v")]*r-u(v"))}
(objects which are not in explored regions and give the greatest increase in the diameter of explored regions of the graph, weighted by the known ratings given by the user)

where E is the expectation: exploration and rating of a node are drawn from a random distribution: when an object is recommended, we "make" the user explore the recommended node, and this modifies the exploration/rating distributions (if the user has enjoyed the recommended object, they will most likely be willing to explore the neighbours of this object).
f-u would likely be submodular (a node can be explored only once, thus at a given point in time, the number of explored elements will increase less and less strongly).

\section{Method}

The idea would be to use the OIMP (Online Influence Maximization with Persistence) method developped in [Lagrée et al., 2017]. The concept of restricting the set of candidates to a number K of objects (with their supports) might suit the idea to restrict recommendations to non-explored suitable regions:

For a given user u, a fixed parameter K (number of candidates)
For each round 1 up to a finite horizon T
	Compute the set of relevant candidates c-1, ..., c-k with their support A-1, ..., A-k (*)
	Compute a score of relevance for each candidate
	Select the (1) candidate with the highest score
	Observe reward r (rating of the recommended object by user u)
	Write the associated regret: real best candidate reward (among the k selected candidates) - r
	Improve the algorithm: update statistics accordingly for score computation
Return cumulative regret up to horizon T for comparison with other methods
In order to check the serendipity part, we can also keep track of the exploration of each object region: if the recommendation has succeeded in increasing the exploration of the user, the exploration of each region should increase: a mean to quantify this is to compute the volume of the parallelotope which relies on explored (by user u) objects o-1, o-2, ..., o-n as follows: V = (o-1, ..., o-n) and Vol(o-1, ..., o-n) = sqrt(det(V*V-T)) . This volume should increase more for recommendation with serendipity than for regular recommendation, because recommended objects are supposed to be less correlated (similar). [1]

The goal of this algorithm is then to infer the real edge weights (which corresponds, for an edge (i, j), to the probability of user u liking object i (j) knowing its rating of object j (i)) in an online setting.

(*) This is a difficult problem. Lagrée et al. suggest Max-degree or Cover as general strategies to find plausible candidates. One idea is to implement serendipity at this point of the bandit algorithm: select 1 "centroid" (either by K-means, or by Max-degree) in each unexplored object region at distance at least s from the explored regions.

Another issue is the missing data in most of the datasets (MovieLens included). We can restrict movies to objects having a minimal number of ratings, and, for each movie, the reward is a noisy observation of the empirical mean of the ratings in the dataset (using multinomial or Gaussian distributions): "semi-simulated data".

We implicitly assume that the number of "centroids" will be far lesser than the number of nodes in the object graph. When computing the regret, we also assume that the best "arm" we could use is among the K selected candidates, thus that we do not question the method with which we select the candidates, which is an hypothesis made in the [Lagrée et al., 2017] article.

\section{Discussion}

%TODO

NeurIPS requires electronic submissions.  The electronic submission site is
\begin{center}
  \url{https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/NeurIPS2018/}
\end{center}

Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully.

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to NeurIPS 2018 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to eight pages long,
including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only acknowledgments and/or
  cited references} are allowed. Papers that exceed eight pages of content
(ignoring references) will not be reviewed, or in any other way considered for
presentation at the conference.

The margins in 2018 are the same as since 2007, which allow for $\sim$$15\%$
more words in the paper compared to earlier years.

Authors are required to use the NeurIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files
and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
rejection.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on
the World Wide Web at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://www.neurips.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+neurips_2018.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
various formatting requirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.

The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2018 is \verb+neurips_2018.sty+,
rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{} 2.09,
  Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}

The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
\verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.

\paragraph{New preprint option for 2018}
If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a
nonanonymized version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit. Please \textbf{do
  not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
papers accepted to NeurIPS.

At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.

The file \verb+neurips_2018.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
the paper with your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
top of the page.

For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
of space.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
following before loading the \verb+neurips_2018+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2018}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
color.

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
  menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
  also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
  available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
  acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
  "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
  the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
necessary.
