## PROPOSITION

Name: Recommender system with serendipity

Topic:  online region exploration, recommendation

Category: review, implementation, theory

Description: A lacking feature of current recommender systems is that they usually do not allow discovery of new elements, that is, an element that might be interesting, but which is different of what the user is used to. [1] has introduced a method that might recommend novel items. 

The goal of this project is to formalize the problem (in particular, the modelling of the users' behaviour), to extend it to an online setting, to offer a review of the cases that might be correctly processed by this type of clustering and not by regular ones, and to design a method of region exploration that might solve this issue, by determining which criteria should be taken into account and possibly maximized.

## PROBLEM OF RECOMMENDATION WITH SERENDIPITY

Input: 
- U set of users
- O set of objects
- s_o (attribute-based) similarity between objects
- s_u (behavioural) similarity between users
- u a specific user asking for a recommendation among objects in O
- t serendipity threshold (in % of people in userbase/user network that have seen the object)

Output:
- object o with two characteristics:
-> likely to be enjoyed by user u: "item relevance"
-> outside what u is used to see: "item novelty"

## FORMALIZATION OF ITEM RELEVANCE AND NOVELTY

- Item relevance: ?
- Item novelty: ?

## METHOD

- Online inference of user network (let us assume for now that the set of users is fixed)
- A part of the ratings is known, the other is hidden and will be used for validation
- A priori, the set of objects is fixed and the (attribute-based) similarity graph of objects is fully known (?)
- Apply OIMP algorithm to recommend one object (candidate) to user u (a priori, horizon T = 1 ?) where little is known about the ratings of user u

## MEASURES OF VALIDATION OF RESULTS

Suggestions: expected cumulative regret from IM
- wrt item relevance: ?
- wrt item novelty: ?
