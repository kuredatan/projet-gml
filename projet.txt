##Â PROPOSITION

Name: Recommender system with serendipity

Topic:  online region exploration, recommendation

Category: review, implementation, theory

Description: A lacking feature of current recommender systems is that they usually do not allow discovery of new elements, that is, an element that might be interesting, but which is different of what the user is used to. [1] has introduced a method that might recommend novel items. 

The goal of this project is to formalize the problem (in particular, the modelling of the users' behaviour), to extend it to an online setting, to offer a review of the cases that might be correctly processed by this type of clustering and not by regular ones, and to design a method of region exploration that might solve this issue, by determining which criteria should be taken into account and possibly maximized.
